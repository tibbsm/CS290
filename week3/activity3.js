/*
Deep comparison

The == operator compares objects by identity. 
But sometimes, you would prefer to compare the values of their actual properties.

Write a function, deepEqual, that takes two values and returns true only if they are the same value or are objects with the same properties whose values are also equal when compared with a recursive call to deepEqual.

To find out whether to compare two things by identity (use the === operator for that) or by looking at their properties, you can use the typeof operator. 

If it produces "object" for both values, you should do a deep comparison. But you have to take one silly exception into account: 
by a historical accident, typeof null also produces "object".
